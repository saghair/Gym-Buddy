        <p>
          A good warm-up should make you feel more awake, slightly warm,
          and ready to move, without leaving you tired before your workout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start with 3–5 minutes of light cardio such as walking, cycling,
          or marching in place. Follow this with dynamic movements that
          copy your training session: leg swings, arm circles, easy bodyweight
          squats, and gentle torso rotations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid long, static stretches before heavy lifting. Save them for
          the end of your session when your muscles are warm and relaxed.

        <p>
          The best program is the one you can follow consistently.
          It should match your schedule, your level, and your main goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beginners usually do well with full-body workouts 2–3 times per
          week. If you already have some experience, you might enjoy a split
          like upper / lower or push / pull / legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your life is very busy, choose a simple routine and protect
          those few training days instead of aiming for a “perfect” plan
          you never finish.

          Wipe down equipment after use, put weights back where they belong,
          and avoid blocking mirrors or machines when you are resting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not sit on a machine while scrolling your phone if someone
          is clearly waiting. Offer to let others work in with you if
          you are doing many sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone starts somewhere. Respect others, focus on yourself,
          and use headphones if you like your music loud.
